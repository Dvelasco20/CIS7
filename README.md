**Project General Description:**

Title: Vigenere Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

Description:
This project implements a simple Vigenere cipher encryption and decryption program in C++. The Vigenere cipher is a classical method of encrypting alphabetic text, providing a form of polyalphabetic substitution. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a keyword, providing a basic yet educational example of cryptographic techniques.

**Programming Approaches:**

1. **Modular Design:**
   - The program is designed with modular functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption, promoting code readability and maintainability.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - A user-friendly menu system guides users through the process of encrypting and decrypting messages, providing clear instructions and options.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - While the provided code lacks extensive input validation, future enhancements could include robust input validation to handle various user inputs and improve program reliability.

4. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - The Vigenere cipher algorithm is implemented with attention to detail, incorporating modular arithmetic and ASCII operations to achieve encryption and decryption.

5. **Educational Purpose:**
   - The project is designed not only for practical use but also for educational purposes. It encourages users to understand the Vigenere cipher and its basic principles.

**Basic Instructions:**

1. **Encrypting a Message:**
   - Choose option 1 from the menu.
   - Enter a message to be encrypted.
   - Input the cipherKey to be used for encryption.
   - The program will display the encrypted ciphertext.

2. **Decrypting a Message:**
   - Choose option 2 from the menu.
   - Enter the ciphertext to be decrypted.
   - Input the cipherKey used for encryption.
   - The program will display the decrypted message.

3. **Exiting the Program:**
   - Choose option 0 from the menu.
   - The program will display a thank-you message and exit.

4. **Recommendation:**
   - It is suggested to start by encrypting a message and then decrypting it to verify the correctness of the implementation, as mentioned in the program.

**Note:**
   - The project is a basic implementation, and for practical cryptographic use, more advanced encryption methods and key management practices should be considered.
